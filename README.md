## What is a `Coding dojo`?

A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge.
 They are there to have fun and to engage in deliberate practice in order to improve their skills.

It is very important to keep in mind that:

- Non-competitive, collaborative, fun environment is mandatory
- All skill levels are welcome
- It is safe to try new ideas

Read more about it [here](https://codingdojo.org/WhatIsCodingDojo).

## Make everything `Easy to share`

Every piece of documentation uses a text based language to make it simple to write and share.

- Markdown for site and blog posts: [hugo.io](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start)
- HTML for slides: [reveal-js](https://revealjs.com/installation/#full-setup)
- DOT for diagrams and schemes: [Graphviz Documentation](https://graphs.grevian.org/example) and [Online Editor](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline)

## Make everything `Remote first`

Because we are going through a remote first era, all events and interactions are remote first.

- IDE: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Liveshare](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/services/live-share) plugin
